    <!--
      The element below instructs the browser to generate distributed affordance
      for the element with ID "book".

      It's crucial to note that the distributed affordance generator
      has never heard of the book "The Catcher in the Rye" or this page.
      It only knows that it has services that operate on books.
      These descriptions are then "instantiated" to make the links
      directly point to a page that concerns the book.
      For instance, the "Buy on Amazon" link goes directly to the book page,
      instead of simply to the Amazon home page or search page.
